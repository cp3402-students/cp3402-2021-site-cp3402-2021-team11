How do they add new content– as a page or a post?
The way content is displayed on this site is through the use of pages. Having the content displayed this way was chosen becasue each page will contains different information that will be relivant to that page's call to action. This allowed for a more streamline and reduce clutter on the page. 

On the home screen there is a section on the site that dispalys Facebook event they are edited via the use of a custom HTML code block. The actual HTML cose is proveded form this page: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin/
The only thing thagt is required for the events to be shown is that the event be published on the facebook page hosting the event. Once the HTML code is generated and copied it is added to the custom HTML code block which then displays the event on the website.
