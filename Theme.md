Features:

Features of the website were implemented to make the website user friendly. The sign Up button feature was placed on the home page to capture the users attention. Instead of having a link in a Text form, a button was used to make the sign up option visible to the visitors. The naviagtion bar and Menu labels were decided according to the content. A web form was designed to allow visitors to get in contact and sign up for membership with Townsville Jazz club.

Design Decision/Colours

Colors:
- Purple and Yellow
- White
- Black 

Design Decisions and Colours were incorporated into the website based on the clients requests. The primary colours of  yellow and purple were the clients colour choices. Taking into consideration of his request we used a blend of purple and yellow and also white to keep the pages bright as requested by our client.  A simple design is easier to scan through and find information you want as an internet user. Filtering out unnecessary elements draws the attention to what matters most to the site visitors. Also, when considering the maintenance of the website a simple design is also easier to build and fix making it easier for a new developer to continue on the theme. Having a massive clustered site, can be difficult to keep things organised and updating the site can become and hustle.
