# Theme Development

### Summary  
Our theme is featured on all pages and affects fonts, banners and our custom green button on the homepage. Its aim is to increase readibility and visual appeal, while also highlighting our call to action. One example of this is the bright yellow "Townsville Jazz Club" title with membership prices below it which directs users to our call to action by contrasting the rest of the page. We applied a similar principle when designing the green sign-up button on the Home page.

### Files that need editing  
Information is key and updating of certain files in the website is important to make sure members and visitors are up to date with with key events and details. Details such as Weekly events, Contact details and the Newsletter will be the main files which will need editing to keep visitors and member up to date with the latest Townsville Jazz Clubs events. 

### Design Decision/Colours  
Colors:
- Purple and Yellow
- White
- Black 

Design Decisions and Colours were incorporated into the website based on the clients requests. The primary colours of  yellow and purple were the clients colour choices. Taking into consideration of his request we used a blend of purple and yellow and also white to keep the pages bright as requested by our client.  A simple design is easier to scan through and find information you want as an internet user. Filtering out unnecessary elements draws the attention to what matters most to the site visitors. Also, when considering the maintenance of the website a simple design is also easier to build and fix making it easier for a new developer to continue on the theme. Having a massive clustered site, can be difficult to keep things organised and updating the site can become and hustle.
