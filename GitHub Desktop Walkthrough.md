Walthrough for setting up and using GitHub Desktop

Step 1: go to this site https://desktop.github.com/ and download the installer

Step 2: Run the installer, you will be prompted to sign into GitHub. You will need to use the email 
	that has access to the online GitHub. Note you will be promted to let an application use the 
	GitHub link, just select GitHub Desktop from the drop down

Step 3: You should now have the application displaying 'configure git' select the use my GitHub account name
	and email address. Make sure under email you have selected the email that has access to the GitHub
	Project.

Step 4: You should now be on the 'Let's get started!'. First thing you want to do is clone the GitHub Repository
	of the project to your computer. To do this you will need to select 'Clone a repository from the internet
	and slect cp3402-studdents/cp3402-2021-site-cp3402-2021-team11. This will then start cloning the repository
	to your computer, just wait unti the loading is finsihed. You should now have GitHub Desktop running.

Step 5: Take note of the layout of Github Desktop, at the top you will have the current repository, the current
	branch you are working on and anything you have fetched from the repository. Now slectec the open repository
	in your external editor (I used Noted++ which it recomends), this will be under where it says no local changes.
	Once you have done this you should have a notepad open with each of the files from the repository.

Step 6: Firstly we will go over creating a new file and then sending that to the repository by commiting it. In 
	Notepad go to file and select new, this will create a blank text file which you can add to and edit.
	Now go to file in notepad and select save as, make sure that you are saving into your local repository
	(will look something like this C:\Users\'Your User Name'\Documents\GitHub\cp3402-2021-site-cp3402-2021-team11).
	Name your new file adding '.md' to the end of the name, then select the drop down for 'save as type' and
	select 'All types" (should be at the top). Now hit save and click back onto you GitHub Desktop app, you shoud
	now see under changes the new file you have created which if you happy with it you can add a description
	and then select commit to main.
